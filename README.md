# Python-ROS---Image-Detection-with-Mobile-Robots
The goal of this project is to use computer vision for mobile robots in simulation. More specifically, I aimed to learn how to use camera sensor readings from the robot in simulation and use a CNN-based object recognition to find a target image in the simulation environment.
